ADVANCED TREMULOUS COMBAT SIMULATOR

	A combat training simulator pitting mercenaries against vicious aliens.

	This is an updated version of the Advanced Tactical Combat Simulator
	for Tremulous 1.1. Most of the textures were replaced with higher
	resolution versions and locations were added.
	
	The original map was made by Jex, the textures were updated by Superpie,
	the map was updated by Ingar. For the occasion, the map was renamed to
	"Advanced Tremulous Combat Simulator".
